This website re-design is based on the website www.mogstation.com

A site created by Square Enix for the MMORPG game Final Fantasy XIV.

To navigate the website, use the Navbar at the top to reach the Login and Registration pages.

The last webpage is accessible by clicking on the "Forgot Password" link in the log-in form.

The four definable sections of this re-design are:

1. The Navbar used on all pages
2. The Login Form
3. The Registration Page
3. The Forgot Password Page

There are several buttons and elements that include the href element, but do not lead anywhere.
This is because in the original website they do, but for the sake of my project I excluded any
web pages that were not made by myself.
